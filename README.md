#uTZVisor Hardware Control-Flow Integrity (hCFI) \& Hardware Data-Flow Integrity (hDFI)
This project focuses on the development of two mitigation techniques, Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Data-Flow Integrity (DFI), part of the Health Monitor module from the in-house developed uTZVisor hypervisor. Respectively, these techniques ensure that the hypervisor follows a pre-determined execution path and that its data integrity is not compromised. Both logic is hardware implemented to maximize performance and minimize potential targets of attacks.
